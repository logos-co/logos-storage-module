# There is one spec:
#   storage-module-runtime.test.yaml — packages this module as an .lgx, installs
#       it with lgpm, and drives it through a headless logoscore daemon (init,
#       start, upload a local file, stop).
#
# The runner is the shared `doctest` CLI
# (https://github.com/logos-co/logos-doctest), invoked directly via its flake.
# Each spec runs into ./outputs/ via --output-dir; `doctest generate` renders the
# .md; `doctest clean` then strips build artifacts, keeping only the .md.
#
# To run against a local logos-doctest checkout instead of the published flake,
# set DOCTEST, e.g.:  DOCTEST="nix run path:../../logos-doctest --" ./run.sh
#
set -euo pipefail

# fall back to latest master.
